# EEG-Denoising
Repository for the BMME 575 Machine Learning Project. Goal of the project was to replicate a ML model in IEEE and replicate the results of the paper

Literature for Inspiration was [A Segmentation-Denoising Network for Artifact Removal From Single-Channel EEG](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130669)
Data used was from [EEGdenoiseNet](https://github.com/ncclabsustech/EEGdenoiseNet/tree/master)
